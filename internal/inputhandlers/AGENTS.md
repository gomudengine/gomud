# Input Handlers Guide

## Scope

- Use this file for login flows, system command handling, terminal-protocol input handling, and interactive input processing in `internal/inputhandlers`.
- This package sits on the boundary between raw client input and account/session state.

## Working Rules

- Be careful with login and account-creation flow changes. Small handler changes can break reconnects, prompt flow, or auth behavior.
- Preserve the distinction between system commands, prompt handling, protocol sanitization, and normal command processing.
- If a change touches telnet or ANSI parsing, inspect the matching terminal/connection behavior together rather than patching only one side.
- Avoid adding gameplay-specific command policy here when it belongs in `internal/usercommands`.

## Verification

- Run targeted package tests for login or input-processing changes.
- If the change affects prompt or login flow, verify the exact user interaction path you changed.
- Call out any live terminal or multi-step prompt behavior that was not exercised directly.

## Documentation

- Keep this file about input and login guardrails, not a walkthrough of the full login stack.
