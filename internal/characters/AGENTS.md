# Characters Package Context

## Overview
The `internal/characters` package is the core character system for GoMud, handling both player characters (PCs) and non-player characters (NPCs/mobs). It provides a comprehensive character model with stats, equipment, skills, combat mechanics, and various character states.

## Key Components

### Core Character Structure (`character.go`)
- **Character struct**: The main character entity containing all character data
- **Character creation and management**: Factory functions and lifecycle management
- **Stat calculations**: Dynamic stat computation with buffs, equipment, and racial modifiers
- **Experience and leveling**: Level progression and TNL (To Next Level) calculations
- **Persistence**: Character data serialization/deserialization

### Room Visit Tracking (`roombitset.go`)
- **RoomBitset**: Chunked bitset type (`map[uint16]uint64`) for memory-efficient permanent room visit tracking
- **Block-based storage**: Each map key is `roomId/64`; each value is a `uint64` bitmask covering that 64-room window
- **Zone-sharded on Character**: `ZonesVisited map[string]RoomBitset` persisted to YAML under `zonesvisited`
- **Human-readable serialization**: Blocks serialize as hex strings (e.g. `"0x000000000000003F"`) for debuggable save files
- **Pruning**: `RoomBitset.Prune(validRoomIds)` clears bits for deleted rooms and removes empty blocks

### Character Statistics System
- **Six core stats**: Strength, Speed, Smarts, Vitality, Mysticism, Perception
- **Stat scaling**: Stats over 100 use `SQRT(overage)*2` formula for diminishing returns
- **Dynamic modifiers**: Equipment, buffs, and racial bonuses affect final stats
- **Stat points**: Manual allocation points gained per level

### Equipment System (`worn.go`)
- **Equipment slots**: Weapon, Offhand, Head, Neck, Body, Belt, Gloves, Ring, Legs, Feet
- **Stat modifications**: Equipment provides stat bonuses aggregated across all slots
- **Item management**: Worn item tracking and validation
- **Slot accessors**: `Get(slot)` and `Set(slot, item)` are the only places that map an `items.ItemType` to a `Worn` struct field; all other code iterates via `AllSlots()`, `ArmorSlots()`, or `WeaponSlots()`
- **Display labels**: `SlotLabel(slot)` returns the canonical UI label (e.g. `"Head:"`) so rendering code does not hard-code slot names

### Character States and Modifiers
- **Alignment system** (`alignment.go`): Good/neutral/evil alignment with numeric values (-100 to +100)
- **Aggro system** (`aggro.go`): Combat targeting and threat management
- **Buffs integration**: Status effects that modify character capabilities
- **Cooldowns** (`cooldowns.go`): Time-based ability restrictions

### Combat and Interaction Systems
- **Kill/Death statistics** (`kdstats.go`): PvP and PvE combat tracking
- **Charm system** (`charminfo.go`): Mind control and pet mechanics
- **Mob mastery** (`mobmastery.go`): Character proficiency with specific creature types
- **Shop system** (`shop.go`): NPC merchant capabilities with restocking mechanics

### Character Presentation
- **Formatted names** (`formattedname.go`): Rich text rendering with adjectives and color coding
- **Adjectives system**: Visual indicators for character states (sleeping, charmed, poisoned, etc.)
- **Quest indicators**: Visual markers for quest-relevant NPCs

## Key Features

### Character Persistence
- YAML-based character data storage
- Automatic saving with configurable intervals
- Character creation timestamps and history tracking
- Short-term room history for map rendering (`roomHistory`, capped by memory capacity)
- Permanent room visit tracking via `ZonesVisited` (chunked bitset, persisted to YAML)

### Dynamic Stat System
- Base stats from race definitions
- Equipment stat modifications
- Buff/debuff effects
- Manual stat point allocation
- Calculated maximums for Health, Mana, and Action Points

### Social and Economic Systems
- Gold and banking system
- Player shops and merchant NPCs
- Clan membership support
- Pet ownership and management
- Quest progress tracking

### Combat Integration
- Aggro management for targeting
- Damage tracking between players
- Combat state management
- Weapon and armor effectiveness

### Scripting Integration
- JavaScript-accessible character properties
- Event-driven character updates
- Scriptable character behaviors for NPCs

## Dependencies
- `internal/stats`: Core statistics definitions
- `internal/items`: Item system integration
- `internal/buffs`: Status effect system
- `internal/races`: Character race definitions
- `internal/skills`: Skill system integration
- `internal/spells`: Magic system integration
- `internal/quests`: Quest system integration
- `internal/pets`: Pet system integration
- `internal/gametime`: Time-based mechanics
- `internal/colorpatterns`: Text formatting and colors

## Usage Patterns
- Character creation through factory functions
- Stat calculations via getter methods that apply all modifiers
- Equipment management through worn item slots
- State management through adjectives and flags
- Combat integration through aggro and damage tracking
- Room visit tracking via `MarkVisitedRoom(roomId, zone)` and queried with `HasVisitedRoom(roomId, zone)`
- Zone exploration progress via `ZoneVisitProgress(zone, validRoomIds)` returning `(visited, total int)`

## Testing
Comprehensive test coverage in `*_test.go` files covering:
- Character creation and initialization
- Stat calculation accuracy
- Equipment stat aggregation
- Alignment system functionality
- Shop mechanics and restocking
- Kill/death tracking
- Cooldown management
- `RoomBitset` set/has/count/prune operations
- `RoomBitset` YAML round-trip serialization
- `MarkVisitedRoom`, `HasVisitedRoom`, and `ZoneVisitProgress` integration

This package serves as the foundation for all character-related functionality in GoMud, providing a rich and flexible character model that supports both player and NPC needs.

## How can new slots be added, removed, or changed?

The slot system is designed so that adding, removing, or renaming a slot requires touching the fewest possible files. Follow these steps in order.

### Adding a new slot

1. **`internal/items/itemspec.go`** — Add the new `ItemType` constant (e.g. `Shoulders ItemType = "shoulders"`). Add it to `AllEquipSlots()`, and to `ArmorSlots()` or `WeaponSlots()` as appropriate. This is the single source of truth for the ordered slot list.

2. **`internal/characters/worn.go`** — Add the new field to the `Worn` struct with a matching YAML tag. Add a case for it in `Get()` and `Set()`. Add it to `SlotLabel()`. No other functions in this file need changing — `StatMod`, `EnableAll`, `GetAllItems`, and the package-level helpers all loop via `AllSlots()` and will pick up the new slot automatically.

3. **`internal/characters/character.go`** — The `Wear()` function contains an explicit `switch` for slot-specific equip logic. If the new slot has standard equip behavior (check disabled, displace old item, place new item), add a `case` for it alongside the existing simple armor cases (`Head` through `Feet`). If it has special behavior like `Weapon`/`Offhand`, add full case logic. All other functions in this file loop via `AllSlots()` and need no changes.

4. **Race data files** — If any races should have the new slot disabled, add the slot name to their `disabledslots` list in the YAML data files under `_datafiles/races/`.

5. **Item data files** — Create item specs with `type: newslot` under the appropriate folder in `_datafiles/items/` so items can be assigned to the new slot.

### Removing a slot

Reverse the steps above. Remove the constant from `AllEquipSlots()` (and `ArmorSlots()`/`WeaponSlots()`), remove the struct field and its `Get`/`Set`/`SlotLabel` cases, remove the `Wear()` case, and migrate or delete any item data files that used the slot type.

### Renaming a slot

Rename the `ItemType` constant value string and update the YAML tag on the `Worn` field to match. The constant name itself (e.g. `items.Shoulders`) can be renamed with a project-wide symbol rename. The string value (e.g. `"shoulders"`) is persisted in character save files and item data files, so a data migration is required if live saves exist.

### Files that do NOT need changes for a new slot

Because they loop via `AllSlots()` or delegate to `Worn.Get()`/`Set()`:
- `Worn.StatMod`, `Worn.EnableAll`, `Worn.GetAllItems`
- `Character.GetDefense`, `GetAllWornItems`, `GetGearValue`, `Validate`, `Uncurse`, `RemoveFromBody`, `BestUpgrades`, `SetRace`, `FindOnBody`
- `internal/races/races.go` `GetEnabledSlots`
- `internal/combat/armor_rank.go` `armorSlotSet`
- `internal/usercommands/inventory.panels.go` equipment panel
- `internal/usercommands/status.panels.go` stat bonuses panel
- `internal/mobs/mobs.go` and `internal/combat/simulate.go` equipment validation loops
- `modules/gmcp/gmcp.Char.go` — `buildWornPayload` iterates `items.AllEquipSlots()` automatically
