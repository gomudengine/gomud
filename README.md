## Setup

### Requirements

- `go` 1.24 or newer
- Optional: `docker` for container builds/test/runs

### Quick Start

In a Terminal, run the following commands:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/GoMudEngine/GoMud.git
cd GoMud

make reset-admin-pw   # set a new default admin password
make run              # runs GoMud server using `go`

make docker-run       # Alternatively, run the GoMud server using `docker`
```

Then open your browser to: `http://localhost`

---

## Connecting

When the GoMud server is running, you can connect it via the Terminal, or with a web browser.

- Telnet: `localhost:33333` or `localhost:44444`
- Local-only telnet port: `127.0.0.1:9999`

- Web client: [http://localhost/webclient](http://localhost/webclient)
- Web admin: [http://localhost/admin/](http://localhost/admin/)

**Important:** Run `make reset-admin-pw`, otherwise your default world will launch with these credentials:

- Username: `admin`
- Password: `password`

## Common Server Commands

In a Terminal, run one of the following commands:

```shell

make run          # runs GoMud using the `go` framework

make build        # creates a executable binary of GoMud at `./go-mud-server`

make run-docker   # runs GoMud in a container using Docker Compose

make help         # shows all available `make` command options
```

## Configuration

### Config Files

GoMud loads configuration in layers so you can keep your own world-specific changes separate from the bundled defaults:

```text
_datafiles/config.yaml
  -> FilePaths.DataFiles (defaults to _datafiles/world/default)
      -> {DataFiles}/config-overrides.yaml
          -> environment variables such as CONFIG_PATH, LOG_PATH, LOG_LEVEL, LOG_NOCOLOR
```

- `_datafiles/config.yaml` is the bundled base config that ships with the repo, and shouldn't be edited or changed.
- `FilePaths.DataFiles` points at the active world data directory. By default that is `_datafiles/world/default`.
- `{DataFiles}/config-overrides.yaml` is the normal place to save local overrides for a world.
- `CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/config.yaml` can point GoMud at a different override file when you want to keep it outside the repo or maintain separate deploy-specific settings.

- For upgrades, treat `_datafiles/config.yaml` as a reference file, not your day-to-day edit target. 
= Keep your custom changes in `config-overrides.yaml` or a separate file selected with `CONFIG_PATH` so pulling new code does not overwrite your local settings.

### Enable Server HTTPS Support

GoMud can serve HTTPS when you provide a certificate and private key, or can be automated using LetsEncrypt provisioning.

For a guided HTTPS setup process, run:

```shell
make https-setup
```

When the admin interface is enabled, `/admin/https/` shows the current HTTPS mode, the checks GoMud ran, and the next steps needed to finish setup.

### Build Commands

| Command            | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `make build`       | Validates and builds the server binary.                                     |
| `make run`         | Generates module imports and starts the server with `go run .`.             |
| `make run-new`     | Deletes generated room instance data, then starts the server fresh.         |
| `make run-docker`  | Builds and starts the server container from `compose.yml`.                  |
| `make https-setup` | Runs the interactive HTTPS certificate setup helper.                        |
| `make reset-admin-pw` | Interactively resets the admin user's password.                          |
| `make test`        | Runs code generation, JavaScript linting, and `go test -race ./...`.        |
| `make validate`    | Runs `fmtcheck` and `go vet`.                                               |
| `make ci-local`    | Builds the local CI container and runs workflow validation.                 |
| `make help`        | Lists the available developer targets.                                      |

### Env Vars

When running, several environment variables can be set to alter behaviors of the mud:

| Variable      | Example Value                   | Descripton                           |
|---------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `CONFIG_PATH` | `/path/to/config.yaml`          | Use alternate config file            |
| `LOG_PATH`    | `/path/to/log.txt`              | Log to file instead of stderr        |
| `LOG_LEVEL`   | `LOW` / `MEDIUM` / `HIGH`       | Set verbosity (rotates at 100MB)     |
| `LOG_NOCOLOR` | `1`                             | Disable colored log output           |

### Why Go?

Why not?

Go provides a number of practical benefits:

- **Compatible**: Easily builds across platforms and CPU architectures (Windows, Linux, MacOS, etc).
- **Fast**: Execution and build times are quick, and GoMud builds in just a couple of seconds.
- **Opinionated**: Consistent style/patterns make it easy to jump into any Go project.
- **Modern**: A relatively new language without decades of accumulated baggage.
- **Upgradable**: Strong backward compatibility makes version upgrades simple and low-risk.
- **Statically linked**: Built binaries have no dependency headaches.
- **No central registries**: Dependencies are pulled directly from source repositories.
- **Concurrent**: Concurrency is built into the language itself, not bolted on via external libraries.
